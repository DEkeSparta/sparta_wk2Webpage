      <h1>What makes a good Gaming PC?</h1>
      <h3>What qualities they need, and why</h3>

      <p class="openPara">A gaming computer is a personal computer designed for playing computationally demanding video games. Due to the integration of common hardware components onto the motherboard since the 1990s, a modern gaming computer is comparable to a mainstream computer with the addition of performance-oriented components, such as video cards and high core-count CPUs. Gaming computers are often associated with enthusiast computing due to an overlap in interests; however, while a gaming PC is built to achieve performance for actual gameplay, enthusiast PCs are built to maximize performance, using games as a real application benchmark. Whereas enthusiast PCs are high-end by definition, gaming PCs can be subdivided into low-end, mid-range, and high-end markets. Video card manufacturers earn the bulk of their revenue from their low-end and mid-range offerings</p>

      <h2>Resolution</h2>
      <p>The display resolution or display modes of a digital television, computer monitor or display device is the number of distinct pixels in each dimension that can be displayed. It can be an ambiguous term especially as the displayed resolution is controlled by different factors in cathode ray tube (CRT) displays, flat-panel displays (including liquid-crystal displays) and projection displays using fixed picture-element (pixel) arrays.

      It is usually quoted as width × height, with the units in pixels: for example, "1024 × 768" means the width is 1024 pixels and the height is 768 pixels. This example would normally be spoken as "ten twenty-four by seven sixty-eight" or "ten twenty-four by seven six eight".</p>

      <h2>Performance</h2>
      <p>
        Computer performance is the amount of work accomplished by a computer system. Depending on the context, high computer performance may involve one or more of the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Short response time for a given piece of work</li>
          <li>High throughput (rate of processing work)</li>
          <li>Low utilization of computing resource(s)</li>
          <li>High availability of the computing system or application</li>
          <li>Fast (or highly compact) data compression and decompression</li>
          <li>High bandwidth</li>
          <li>Short data transmission time</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Multitasking</h2>
      <p>In computing, multitasking is the concurrent execution of multiple tasks (also known as processes) over a certain period of time. New tasks can interrupt already started ones before they finish, instead of waiting for them to end. As a result, a computer executes segments of multiple tasks in an interleaved manner, while the tasks share common processing resources such as central processing units (CPUs) and main memory. Multitasking automatically interrupts the running program, saving its state (partial results, memory contents and computer register contents) and loading the saved state of another program and transferring control to it. This "context switch" may be initiated at fixed time intervals (pre-emptive multitasking), or the running program may be coded to signal to the supervisory software when it can be interrupted (cooperative multitasking).</p>

      <h2>Compatability</h2>
      <p>There's nothing worse than ordering a bunch of PC parts online, receiving the delivery and finding out that the CPU you've ordered isn't compatible with the motherboard. Some components like the CPU, have specific characteristics that only work with supported hardware. You won't be able to install an Intel CPU into an AMD socket motherboard, for example.

      The main culprit when it comes to compatibility issues is the motherboard, which has to work with various other components, like the CPU, RAM, and more. It's the heart of the PC and needs to interact with various connected hardware, and thus we need to be vigilant when checking specifications and requirements. When building a new machine, it's best to start with the motherboard and CPU. </p>
